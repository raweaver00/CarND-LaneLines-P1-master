## Udacity Road Lane Line Detection

## Project 1: Road Lane Detection

This project develops a road lane detection algorithm.  The project contains
a Jupyter python environment that you can use to download the Jupyter zip
file to run the Jupyter environment P1.pynd file to find lane markings on 
recorded images and videos on public roads to find lane lines.  Videos of the 
algoritm performance can be found in the test_images directory.  Initial images 
of the develpment can be found in the top level.  A P1.html file can also be viewed.
